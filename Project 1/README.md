# StackOverflow 2017 developer dataset
## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [StackOverflow 2017 developer dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) containing responds and stats of developers collected from from the [Stackoverflow 2017 developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) to better understand:
 - General understanding of the demographics of the developers who participated in this surbey
 - Insighs on the salaries of developers, considering their demographics 
 - Exploring the potential to build ML models to try and assess a developers salary based on the data

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/@Faisal_Alageel/how-much-do-developers-earn-a-year-a5fd0d192f79) in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed.
